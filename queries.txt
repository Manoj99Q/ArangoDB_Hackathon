total number of users in the graph
common users between Team Fortress 2 and  Dota 2
can u show the distribution of top 5 most played games by users and also by hours
Find the  top 10 users who played a lot  and which games they have played is common most by hours
top 5 users of top 3 games
Users who have played the most influential game
Find 2nd and 4th Most influential game in the graph and its number of users who played both of them
the  top 3 user who played the most number of games and the games they played
distribution of top 10 users by their playtime and also by their number of games
Which users have the most similar gaming preferences
Which users have the most diverse gaming libraries?
Identifies users who bridge different gaming communities

Here are some examples of users with the most similar gaming preferences:
- User "Users/103559489" and User "Users/103373255" have a similarity score of 1.0.
- User "Users/103559489" and User "Users/117036229" also have a similarity score of 1.0.



do both data const and also individual key constas - NOT NEEDED
- one tool call only for visualizing the graph but can be combined graphs 
or multiple plots and toolcalls
new claude model
Make aql be aware of the data at hand and give it access to the state variables to use it in the code
Instead of iframe; why not genrate a html file and open it in a new tab for visualization

Basic Structure Analysis
Is the relationship between users and games truly bipartite?
Algorithm: Bipartite checking
Analysis: Verifies that users only connect to games and vice versa, with no user-user or game-game direct connections

Algorithm: Degree centrality
Analysis: Identifies users with connections to the most distinct games
Which games are the most popular among the community?
Algorithm: Degree centrality (for games nodes)
Analysis: Finds games played by the most users
Similarity and Community Detection
Which users have the most similar gaming preferences?
Algorithm: Projection to user-user graph + clustering
Analysis: Creates connections between users based on common games, then identifies clusters
If I enjoy these games, which other users have similar taste?
Algorithm: User similarity via bipartite projection
Analysis: Projects the graph to find users with overlapping game libraries
Which games are frequently played together by the same users?
Algorithm: Projection to game-game graph
Analysis: Creates connections between games based on common players
Recommendation and Pattern Analysis
Which games should we recommend to a user based on their current library?
Algorithm: User-game projection + link prediction
Analysis: Identifies potential new connections in the bipartite graph
Are there distinct communities or clusters of gamers with similar preferences?
Algorithm: Spectral clustering on the bipartite graph
Analysis: Groups users based on similar gaming patterns
Which games serve as "bridges" between different gaming communities?
Algorithm: Betweenness centrality
Analysis: Identifies games that connect otherwise separate user communities
Advanced Patterns
Which small set of games represents the most diverse gaming interests?
Algorithm: Minimum edge cover
Analysis: Finds the minimal set of games that cover all users' interests
Who are the users with completely unique gaming tastes compared to others?
Algorithm: Maximum independent set
Analysis: Identifies users with no gaming overlap
If we wanted to pair each user with their most distinctive game, what would those pairings be?
Algorithm: Maximum matching
Analysis: Creates optimal one-to-one pairings between users and games
Which users are the most central in connecting different gaming communities?
Algorithm: Betweenness centrality for users
Analysis: Identifies users who bridge different gaming communities
How redundant are the connections in this gaming community?
Algorithm: Bipartite redundancy
Analysis: Measures how much overlap exists in gaming preferences
